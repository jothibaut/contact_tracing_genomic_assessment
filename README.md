# Assessment of COVID-19 contact tracing network precision via phylogenetic analysis of community-level SARS-CoV-2 genomic data

The whole pipeline is implemented within script main.py.
This repository contains every script from the analysis presented in the paper "A novel methodology for assessing contact tracing precision: Phylogenetic validation of a contact tracing program for COVID-19 in Belgium", Thibaut et al. (unpublished).
